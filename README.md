gobyweb2-plugins
================

Plugin repository for GobyWeb 2.2+. This project hosts plugins for GobyWeb versions 2.2+. 
These plugins are designed to install automatically when run on the compute nodes of the grid.
For more details about GobyWeb, see http://gobyweb.campagnelab.org (web-app) and 
http://campagnelab.org/software/gobyweb/plugins-sdk/ (plugin software development kit to use 
plugins from the command line and facilitate their development).

Please feel free to submit new plugins to this repository as pull requests. Plugins that require
specific software or data not found on a linux node by default must be implemented to provide 
auto-installation of these artifacts.
